## üìä MS Excel Analysis

### Key Features:
- **Data Organization:** The data is neatly organized in Excel for easier analysis.
- **Technical Indicators:** Calculation of Moving Averages and other key indicators.
- **Lookup and Reference Functions:** Utilized **XLOOKUP**, **INDEX**, and **VLOOKUP** functions to efficiently search and retrieve data based on specific criteria.
- **Statistical Analysis:** Performed **Summary Statistics** to calculate measures such as mean, median, and standard deviation.
- **Visualizations:** Charts created to visualize trends, volume, and price movements.

### Functions Used:
- **XLOOKUP:** Was used to efficiently search for and retrieve specific values from a dataset based on a corresponding lookup value. It's particularly useful when working with large datasets where you need to find data points like adjusted close prices or specific dates.
- **INDEX:** function was used to return the value of a cell in a specified row and column within a range. This function is ideal for extracting data from a table or array when the row and column numbers are known, providing flexibility in more complex data manipulations.
- **Summary Statistics:** Calculated key statistical measures to provide insights into the distribution and central tendency of the data.
